## What if I click a burger?
When using this app. You are allow to click "devour" burgers which are then sent to a different list on the page.

This is accomplished by way of using POST AND GET requests to set the state of the burger click to true or false in the database. 

## Entering text and clicking Submit?
Upon entering text and clicking submit, POST AND GET request are fired and the database is updated with your burger. The default state of your burger is Non-Devoured, so it stays in the list on the left until click.

Clicking this fires POST AND GET requests that clear the database and reset burger states.
